# Python based TUI (Terminal User Interface)

### About the Project
This project is a python based terminal user interface, which is user interface where the user can perform a series of actions autonomously without actually typing in the commands.
These actions can include creating file/folder, creating user, giving user some permissions, etc.


### Working
Python TUI lists a set of options to the user. The user can choose which task needs to be performed and select the option corresponding the task.

### Use Case
This project is very helpful in automating the day to day tasks of people such as system admins since their daily tasks involve some of the actions like creating/modifying files and folders, managing users, troubleshooting systems, etc quite oftenly.
So this python based TUI can automate their commonly used actions and even more.
